    <p>The Aim of the project is to identify the text provided and detect the language precisely.This project is developed with  the  NLP Hybrid approach.Which  
        means NLP,ML and Human input are all part of the hybrid approach, which  combines the best of rule-based and machine learning approaches and it uses the language detection dataset which contains text  detais for the versatile 
        languages used.The model is trained predicted training set Naïve Bayes Language identification of the texts laid the foundation for the development of 
        the various NLP tools. And many state-of-the art technologies have been developed by the researchers for processing the formal texts written in most popular languages. Apart from 
        working on formal documents, the NLP researchers have extended their focus on the data obtained from the multi-party chats, discussion forums, blogs, and online reviews. But 
        within the last decade, there has been a rapid expansion of their work to a new direction that  cover a new social media content—microblogs eg.,Twitter, social networks eg., Facebook, 
        comments on news articles, captions on user-contributed images such as on Flickr, and  forums dedicated to specialized topics and needs.The researchers have performed the 
        various investigations to find out why code-mixing occurs in social media.Language detection is usually used to identify the language of business texts like emails and 
        chats. This technique identifies the language of a text and the parts of that text in which the language changes, all the way down to the word level. It is primarily used because these business texts (chats, emails, etc.) can be in various languages. A vital part in natural 
        language processing pipelines is the process of identifying the main language so that every text could be processed by the relevant language specific steps.
